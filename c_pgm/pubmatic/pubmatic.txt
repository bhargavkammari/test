a. All problems to be solved in C. b. Please provide separate .c files for each problem.
	 1. Given 2 arrays A and B, find three indices i,j and k such that A[i] + A[j] = B[k] 
	(Sum of two elements in the first array is an element in the second array) All inputs to be accepted as command line parameters.

 	./twoArray n m a1 a2 a3 .... an b1 b2 b3 .... bm Sample if the arrays are A[7] = {1 2 3 4 5 6 7} B[6] = {11 12 34 56 67 89} 



	the program shall be called as 
	./twoArray 7 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 11 12 34 56 67 89 


2. You are given n sheets of paper. 
	A sheet of paper "A" can be stacked on top of another "B" if length(A) < length(B) and width(A) < width(B). 
	Calculate the height of tallest stack that could be formed out of the given sheets by stacking them on top of each other.
	All inputs to be accepted as command line parameters.

	./paperStack n l1 w1 l2 w2 l3 w3 ..... ln wn 

Ex: For 4 sheets of paper with dimensions as p1(10,20) p2(13,15) p3(2,45) and p4(56,9) the program shall be called as 
./paperStack 4 10 20 13 15 2 45 56 9
